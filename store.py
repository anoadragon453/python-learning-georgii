# You are a shop owner. You sell crab burgers. FOR MONEY!
# You have a few items. You want to sell them.
# Have an interface where someone can do the following things:
#
# * See what items you have for sale and their cost
# * Buy an item (their money goes down) [item goes out of stock once bought]
# * Check their balance and their inventory
# * Sell an item (their money goes up, but not as much as what they bought it for!)
# * Leave the store (or try anyway)
